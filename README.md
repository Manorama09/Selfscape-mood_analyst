# Selfscape 
 

## Our Idea

 

## How do we exactly work?

1. Create an account by signing in.
2. Add your own interests, hobbies and routine commitments, category-wise under Leisure, Learning or Productivity
3. Maintain your diary logs and entries by entering your mood range (from 1-10) for that particular day and a brief description if you wish to.
4. Our virtual assisstant chatbot can help you suggest activities and how to make your day more interesting and productive.
5. Keep a check on your day-to-day mood swings through a well-maintained and color co-ordinated graph analysis.
